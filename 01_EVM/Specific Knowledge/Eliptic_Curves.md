###  ECDSA

  

ECDSA (‘Elliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm’) is the cryptography behind private and public keys used in Bitcoin. It consists of combining the math behind [finite fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field) and [elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve) to create one way equations, meaning you can choose your private key (some number) and easily calculate your public key (some other number). However, I can’t take my public key (or anybody else’s for that matter) and easily calculate their private key.

  
  

### Finite Fields

  

A finite field is exactly like it sounds, a finite set of numbers. The real numbers are an infinite set of numbers, but the set (3, 97, 205, 1,678, 17) is a finite set of numbers. A more interesting and useful set of numbers are the set of integers modulo p, where p is a prime number.

  

### Elliptic Curve

  

Elliptic curves are the set of points described by the equation:

Groups are defined in mathematics if they have:

1.  Closure: If a and b are in a group G, then a + b is in the group G
    
2.  Associativity: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
    
3.  Identity Element: a + 0 = 0 + a = a
    
4.  For every a there exists b such that a + b = 0
    
5.  For Abelian Groups only, commutativity: a + b = b + a
    

Elliptic curves have some of their own specific group laws.

1.  The identity element is the point at infinity, 0
    
2.  The inverse of the point P is the one symmetric about the x axis
    
3.  Addition is defined as: given three aligned, non-zero points, P, Q, and R you have P + Q + R = 0. The order does not matter for these three points, so P + (Q+R) = 0, (P+Q) + R = 0, (P+R) + Q = 0, etc. This allows us to prove elliptic curves are both commutative, and associative.


### Scalar Multiplication and Order  

So you can see how point addition and point doubling allows us to calculate scalar multiplication for xP = R.

  

Elliptic curves over finite fields have the same property. We can continually add P on to itself creating scalar multiplication.

  

Think back to the clock image we used for modulo operations.

  

an example using the equation:

The key point to the above example is calculating the order of a subgroup generated by point P

  

The order of P is defined as the smallest positive integer n such that nP = 0. So in our example, the order of the subgroup based on point P is 5, meaning 5P = 0

Bringing this all together, our example defines the following:

1.  Prime modulo of the finite field = 97
    
2.  The elliptic curve described above where a = 2 and b = 3
    
3.  A random point P = (3,6) — this is called the base point
    
4.  The order of the subgroup (set of cyclic points based on P)=5

### ECDSA and Bitcoin

For Bitcoin, we have the following parameters:

1.  Prime modulo: 2²⁵⁶ - 2³² - 2⁹ - 2⁸ - 2⁷ - 2⁶ - 2⁴ - 1 → this is a really really big number approximately equal to all of the atoms in the universe. It is also represented in hexadecimal as: FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE FFFFFC2F
    
2.  Elliptic curve where a = 0 and b = 7
    
3.  Base point P in hexadecimal = 04 79BE667E F9DCBBAC 55A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 59F2815B 16F81798 483ADA77 26A3C465 5DA4FBFC 0E1108A8 FD17B448 A6855419 9C47D08F FB10D4B8
    
4.  Order in hexadecimal = FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE BAAEDCE6 AF48A03B BFD25E8C D0364141
