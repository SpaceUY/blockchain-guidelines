## Getting Started with Rust: Rustlings Trimmed Version

Welcome to the beginning of your Rust journey! To help you get started and practice your Rust skills, we’ve provided a trimmed version of the Rustlings exercises. This version is designed to give you a focused and manageable introduction to Rust, allowing you to build confidence with the language’s fundamentals.

### Rustlings Trimmed Version

The Rustlings Trimmed Version is a streamlined set of exercises that are perfect for beginners. By working through these exercises, you’ll familiarize yourself with essential Rust concepts and syntax in a hands-on, interactive way. You can find the repository for the trimmed version here:

[https://github.com/SpaceUY/rustlings-trimmed-version](https://github.com/SpaceUY/rustlings-trimmed-version)

Instead of cloning the repository, you can create your own branch to work on the exercises. Please avoid merging your branch into the main branch to ensure that the original exercises remain unaffected.
