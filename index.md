# Welcome to SpaceDev's Blockchain Guidelines!

---

Hey Team!

Welcome to our blockchain guidelines!

This learning hub is your gateway to a wealth of resources on blockchain development, focusing on both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solana ecosystems. Whether you’re a beginner or looking to deepen your expertise, you’ll find materials tailored to your learning journey.

## What You’ll Find Here

• **Educational Resources**: Access a curated collection of guides, videos, PDFs, and articles that cover the fundamentals to advanced topics in blockchain technology.

• **Hands-On Exercises**: Engage with practical exercises and projects designed to enhance your coding skills and understanding of blockchain concepts. These are expected to be coded with typescript as it is by far the stack we use the most at SpaceDev. You can find them in [this repository].

• **Community Support**: Collaborate with colleagues on our [dedicated channel in Mattermost], share insights, and grow together as we navigate the evolving landscape of blockchain technology.

## Our Goal

Our aim is to empower you to develop your career in blockchain, fostering skills that will not only benefit you personally but also drive innovation within our company. By investing in our collective growth, we position ourselves at the forefront of technological advancement.

## Structure

This documentation is first divided in different technologies or areas of knowledge (EVM, Solana, etc.), and inside of each section, you'll find:

• A **basic knowledge guide** with introductory concepts to the specific technology - basically a tech starter pack! This **does not assume prior knowledge**, and should be suitable for both technical and non-technical readers.

• A set of **fundamental theoretical pieces of knowledge**, that will further your journey in each technology. This is aimed at developers who want to learn more about the specific technology. After reading this section, the developer should be able to understand and analyze existing solutions, as well as developing solutions of their own.

• A **developer guide**, which will guide you through common problems and solutions we have explored in SpaceDev, that will help cement the ideas explored in the fundamentals section.

• **Exercises** (when applicable).

## Get Started

Dive in and start exploring the resources available. Don’t hesitate to reach out to mentors and peers within our community for support. Together, we’ll build a strong foundation in blockchain technology and contribute to shaping the future.
