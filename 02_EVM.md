# EVM Guide

The EVM Guide is divided into the following sections:

## 01-Basic initial knowledge

The document has references to videos and documentation that the technical or non-technical reader can access for their first introduction to Blockchain. Does not require prior knowledge.


## 02-Fundamental theoretical knowledge

This content is aimed at developers who must gather initial, basic technical knowledge prior to developing on any of the three fronts.

The purpose of this content is to expand the capabilities of the developer, so that he himself is not limited to what is already known, or to what has already been implemented by other colleagues, but can question existing solutions, suggest improvements and this is only possible if he knows the background of technology.

To exemplify the above. A backend developer without much web3 experience could make new invocations to new smart contracts but may not have enough knowledge to detect:
Because a transaction is not mined or takes a long time to be included in a block.
Because you cannot execute transactions concurrently with the same wallet in EVM

Each topic of knowledge presented here is accompanied by a practical test that helps reaffirm theoretical knowledge. In cases where it does not apply, it is recommended to try to explain what you have learned to a classmate.

## 03-Smart contract Dev with Solidity

This document is aimed at developers who want to get involved in the development of smart contracts with Solidity.  

It has the following sections:

 - **Basic level**: The essentials of solidity.
 - **Advanced level**: Appropriate content to be able to play a role in a productive environment. Topics are covered such as deployment, testing of different types, use of upgradeability patterns, gas optimization.
 - **Specific Issues**: Issues that have been highlighted as recurring or complex and have already been faced/resolved within Space are described.

## 04-Blockchain Backend

This document is aimed at developers who want to get involved in the development of backends in web3 projects.

It has the following sections:

 - **Specific Issues**: Issues that have been highlighted as recurring or complex and have already been faced/resolved within Space are described.
 - **Tools/services**  

## 05-Frontend Blockchain

This document is aimed at developers who want to get involved in the development of frontends in web3 projects.

It has the following sections:

 - **Specific Issues**: Issues that have been highlighted as recurring or complex and have already been faced/resolved within Space are described.
 - **Tools/services**

## Specific-Knowledge

In this section there are documents that detail very specific knowledge in depth. A document under this folder is justified if:

 - Expands a section of the previous documents that requires greater depth.
 - It covers a very specific, not so common, common topic.
